# whow - when, how?

## introduction

Whow is a CLI To-do application, with features such as:
 * A calendar that supports features like tags and importance,
 * To-Dos (of course)
 * Events
 * A daily schedule

And counting. Whow is a CLI application rewritten in Go(lang) with more features than the old python rewrite and the older shell script version that can be found [here](https://github.com/ezntek/old_whow) and [here](https://github.com/DaringCuteSeal/whow). It aims to include extra features such as

 * Filesystem data storage in `toml`
 * Reminders
 * An importable API
 * A daemon for notifications

And counting.

## why did I do this?

The old python rewrite is *old* of course, but also because the implementation is very arse and verbose, this rewrite will aim to improve that. Also because I want more go experience...

## Currently Working on:

 * Bring-up
